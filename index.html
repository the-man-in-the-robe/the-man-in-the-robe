<p>Why trust a chief judge<br />Who asks to see not.</p>
<p>What justice exists<br />Where fact is not sought.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>So blind is a court<br />Too easy boycott.</p>
<p>That hides away from<br />The truth of a plot.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>We've become so frail<br />We hide from a thought.</p>
<p>How is a witness<br />The Nation's weak spot?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Lost is the lady<br />For whom many have fought?</p>
<p>A great sacrafice<br />Succumbs to the rot.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>How will our children's<br />History be taught.</p>
<p>The man in the robe <br />Demands what he ought.</p>
<p>Or will it soon end<br />That he would ask not.</p>
